/**
 * Kernel object representing the client endpoint of an IPC session. Sessions are the basic CTR-OS
 * primitive for communication between different processes, and are used to implement service calls
 * to the various system services.
 *
 * To make a service call, the client must write the command header and parameters to the buffer
 * located at offset 0x80 of the TLS (Thread-Local Storage) area, then execute a SendSyncRequest
 * SVC call with its Session handle. The kernel will read the command header, using it to marshall
 * the parameters to the process at the server endpoint of the session. After the server replies to
 * the request, the response is marshalled back to the caller's TLS buffer and control is
 * transferred back to it.
 *
 * In Citra, only the client endpoint is currently implemented and only HLE calls, where the IPC
 * request is answered by C++ code in the emulator, are supported. When SendSyncRequest is called
 * with the session handle, this class's SyncRequest method is called, which should read the TLS
 * buffer and emulate the call accordingly. Since the code can directly read the emulated memory,
 * no parameter marshalling is done.
 *
 * In the long term, this should be turned into the full-fledged IPC mechanism implemented by
 * CTR-OS so that IPC calls can be optionally handled by the real implementations of processes, as
 * opposed to HLE simulations.
